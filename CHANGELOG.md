# Changelog

## Overview

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a
Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project (very
loosely) models [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The one exception is that I don't expect to actually *reach* a v1.0 in this
go-around. The journey is the point, not necessarily the destination.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/atc0005/atc0005/issues) for any
deviations that you spot; I'm still learning!.
