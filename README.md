# About me

## Systems Administrator

- 18 years experience
- IT support, training, mentoring
- physical, virtual, containerized servers
- strong proponent and use of versioning (Git, Subversion) and configuration
  management (Ansible)

## Junior / Intermediate developer

The Go projects found here reflect the majority of my growth in the Go
language over the last year.

- worked with various languages regularly alongside sysadmin tasks
  - recent: Go, Python, PowerShell, shell scripting
  - past: batch files (don't laugh, it gets the job done), Perl

- studied some languages from an academic pursuit, used knowledge gained with
  later languages used
  - C, C++ (much of knowledge transfers to Go)

- heavy focus on Go programming
  - casually for about a year
  - very strong push (daily, multiple hours) for over a year
