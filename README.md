# About me

## Systems Administrator

I have over 18 years of experience in providing IT support, training and
guidance for environments consisting of physical, virtual and containerized
servers. This is my day job. I heavily utilize versioning (SVN, Git) and
automation wherever possible, though there is much still to do in that area.

## Junior / Intermediate developer

I have worked with various languages during my years as a Systems
Administrator at a junior to intermediate level. This includes batch files
(don't laugh, there is a lot you can do with a batch file), shell scripting,
Perl, Python, PowerShell, ...

I have also studied C and C++ and (thankfully) was able to transfer much of
that investment into later languages that I worked with, such as Go.

My current Go programming focus has been ongoing for close to two years now; I
started with a casual focus at first, then ramped up to a consistent and
driven investment for over a year. The Go projects found here reflect the
majority of that growth.
